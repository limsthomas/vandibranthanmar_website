        <h1>How it all Started</h1>

        <p>In my childhood i use to live in my mothers house. It was at vallakkunnu, a place in Thrissur 
            district in Kerala. Our house was on the main road side where numerous 
            vehicles pass by daily. These vehicles includes those public transport 
            vehicles like, busses ; goods transport vehicles like lorries, tempos, pickups ; 
            and other private vehicles including wide variety of two and four wheelers.
        </p> 
        <p>The huge vehicles were my favourites, and i used to remember the names and timings of the busses passing through 
             that road daily. I enjoyed the weekends to the most, just by sitting in front of the house and 
             clapping hands whenever a vehicle passes by. Also i use to checkout for the fastest bus. In 
             kallettumkara, a place nearby vallakkunnu, there was a railway cross. At the time of gate closing,
              there won't be any vehicles on the road, except the ones moving towards the opposite side. 
        </p>
        <p>At that time, we can merge into a pin drop silence, where we can hear the sound of the train, moving kilometres
              away. The rush of the busses and vehicles after the opening of the railwaygate use to
              give me a serious adrenaline rush.The sounds of their honking, overtaking, gear downing 
              etc still boosts my mind.Those giant machines have stolen my mind forever. 
        </p>

    <aside id="sidebar">
        <p>In the front of our house, there was a pair of beams whose base was circular in shape; which 
            was my first steering. The steering was accompanied by a seating space. And it was one day 
            that i saw a bus from a driving institute passing by, i screamed to them and gave a nice high 
            five, which i got back. 
        </p>

        <p>At that instant i planned in my mind, of taking a heavy licens when it 
            will be time. And i kept my promise.
